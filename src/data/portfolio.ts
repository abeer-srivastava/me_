    bio: `Hey there! I'm Abeer, a passionate Computer Science student at SRMCEM Lucknow.
I love building full-stack web applications and exploring the realms of cloud computing
and data science. When I'm not coding, you'll find me contributing to open source projects
or learning new technologies. I believe in writing clean, maintainable code and creating
user experiences that make a difference.`,
